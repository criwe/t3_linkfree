t3_linkfree
==============================================================

Have a look at [/Documentation/Introduction/Index.rst](./Documentation/Introduction/Index.rst) for full documentation.

Easy to use solution to realise a simple "linktree" (based on https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree).
A basic style is included, maybe not necessarily the most beautiful ;-) But you can easily adopt the style, see "customizing"

# Installation

- Use the extension manager (or composer) to install this extension
- Continue with "usage"!

# Usage

- Add a page for the linktree
- Add an template there
- Insert static template of t3_linkfree
- Configure the extension via the constant editor (logo, name, logolink..)
- Add subpages to add links to your linktree (you can add normal paged, internal or external links)

# Customizing

You can easily change the style by adding your own CSS file. Just set the path via the constant editor. Have a look at https://github.com/MichaelBarney/LinkFree/tree/master/Templates to get some ideas!

# System Requirements

Works with TYPO3 10.4
